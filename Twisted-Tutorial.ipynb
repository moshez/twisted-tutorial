    "You will need:\n",
    "  1. a virtualenv\n",
    "  2. Jupyter notebook running a kernel in that virtualenv\n",
    "  3. Klein and Treq (and therefore Twisted) installed in that kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "To get those:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ virtualenv abc\n",
    "$ . abc/bin/activate\n",
    "$ pip install jupyter[notebook] klein treq\n",
    "$ jupyter notebook Twisted-Tutorial.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is to set up the klein application. If what follows seems a bit arcane, there is no need to worry: it is only needed to integrate Klein properly with Jupyter. Every way of deploying a Klein application will need, eventually, some sort of \"rubber meets road\" part, where we connect the application to the network. There will always be some complicating consideration: which low-level event loop to use? What kind of sockets to listen on? Here is the specific way we do it for this demo on Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another compromise done here is that the entire initialization is in one cell. From a pedagogical perspective, it would have been better to split it. However, this way it is much easier to hit \"restart kernel\" and then re-run the initialization. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what does happen here? (It is safe to skip this part) Jupyter is running on top of the Tornado event loop. Twisted can run its \"reactor\", the Twisted event loop, on top of Tornado's. This is not the default -- the default is the native-Twisted event loop. The first thing we do is install the Tornado reactor. It is important this is the first thing to be done: Twisted will automatically install the default reactor as soon as a reactor is requested, if one is not already installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we created a server endpoint which listens on port 8080. We get the global Klein resource, wrap it in a Site object and connect it to the endpoint. Note that for production use of Klein, it is best not to use the global resource. However, for a quick prototype, it is extremely useful."

Deferreds represent a result that has not arrived yet. A deferred can have a callback attached which indicates what to do when the result arrived. Deferreds will call each callback with the return value of the previous one -- with one exception. If a callback returns a deferred, the next one will be called with the *result* of the deferred.\n",
